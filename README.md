# SolarWinds APM

The `solarwinds-apm` module provides [SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com) instrumentation for Node.js.

It supports most commonly used databases, frameworks, and packages automatically. An
API allows anything to be instrumented.

An [SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com) account is required to view metrics.
Accounts are [free](https://www.solarwinds.com) for development
and testing use. For production usage a [free trial](https://www.solarwinds.com)
is a great way to start.

## Dependencies

This is a **Linux Only package** with no Mac or Windows support. When installed on Mac or Windows (for development) it will degrade gracefully.

It is compatible with Node versions 14, 16 and 18. See [node status](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) for more.

It is dependent on [solarwinds-apm-bindings](https://github.com/solarwindscloud/solarwinds-bindings-node) binary add-on. The SolarWinds APM Agent will first attempt to install a prebuilt binary add-on using [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) and only if that fails, will it attempt to build the add-on from source using [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix).

Building with node-gyp (via node-pre-gyp) requires:

- Python (2 or 3 depending on version of npm)
- make
- A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC

## Installation

The `solarwinds-apm` module is [available on npm](http://npmjs.org/package/solarwinds-apm) and can be installed
by navigating to your app root and running:

```
npm install --save solarwinds-apm
```

The agent requires a service key, obtained from the SolarWinds dashboard under "Organization Details",
to connect to your account.  This is set via the `SW_APM_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable, make
sure it is available in the environment where your application is running:

```
export SW_APM_SERVICE_KEY="api-token-here:your-service-name"
```

Then, at the top of your main js file for your app, add this:

```
require('solarwinds-apm')
```

Now restart your app and you should see data in your SolarWinds dashboard in a minute or two.

## Important!

`solarwinds-apm` should be the first file required. If, for example, you are using the `esm`
package to enable ES module syntax (import rather than require) and you use the following
command to invoke your program `node -r esm index.js` then `esm.js` is loaded first and
`solarwinds-apm` is unable to instrument modules. You can use it, just make sure to require
`solarwinds-apm` first, e.g., `node -r solarwinds-apm -r esm index.js`.

If you are using the custom instrumentation SDK then SolarWinds APM must be loaded in the code
so that a reference to the SDK is obtained, like `const ao = require('solarwinds-apm')`. It
is still be possible to use the command line `node -r solarwinds-apm -r esm index.js`; the
require in the code will just get a reference to the results of the command line require.

## Configuration

See the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/solarwindscloud/solarwinds-apm-node/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md)

## Upgrading

To upgrade an existing installation, navigate to your app root and run:

```
npm install --save solarwinds-apm@latest
```
