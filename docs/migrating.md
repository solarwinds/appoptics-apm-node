## appoptics-apm migration guide v8 => v9

If you are using `appoptics-apm` out-of-the-box with no custom instrumentation
then no migration is necessary. You can stop reading now.

### Background

In order to detect error conditions in the AWS lambda environment it was necessary
to replace the promise-to-callback shim in `pStartOrContinueTrace()` with direct
support of promises.

### Summary of changes

- in previous versions if the function passed to `pStartOrContinueTrace()` did not
return a `thenable` the span would be completed by making the callback. In v9, the
span will never complete because there is no callback mechanism underlying
`pStartOrContinueTrace()`.
- calling `span.run()` will not work for spans that return promises. `span.runPromise()`
must be called. It is not possible for `span.run()` to detect whether the function will
return a promise or not. `span.run()` may still be used with synchronous and callback-based
functions. Previously this would work because promise-spans were really callback-spans.
- `ao.serviceKey` - this property has been removed; it is no longer valid in all cases. If
you require the service key in your code either fetch it from the environment or read your
configuration file.
- in v8 if `SW_APM_LOG_SETTINGS` was the empty string then the default logging 'error,warn'
would be used. in v9 that means no logging is enabled.
- some error messages have changed to be more consistent.
- the config file name is now `appoptics-apm-config`. It can still be either `.json` or `.js`.

## appoptics-apm migration guide v7 => v8

If you are using `appoptics-apm` out-of-the-box with no custom instrumentation
then no migration is necessary. You can stop reading now.

### Background

Prior to v8 `appoptics-apm` used a different version of the low-level
`appoptics-bindings` library that exposed low-level `metadata` and `events`
as separate objects. v10 of `appoptics-bindings` exposes only `events`, so
any references to `metadata` or the `Metadata` class need to be replaced.

In this section `ao` refers to the module `appoptics-apm`, e.g.,
`const ao = require('appoptics-apm')` and `aob` refers to `ao.addon`,
the `appoptics-bindings` module.

### Summary of changes

- the class `aob.Metadata` has been incorporated into the class `aob.Event`.
  - `aob.Metadata.makeRandom()` => `aob.Event.makeRandom()`
  - `aob.Metadata.sampleFlagIsSet()` => `ao.sampling()`
- `aob.Reporter.sendReport()` is now an `aob.Event` class method
  - use `event.sendReport()`
- the log format `%m` (metadata) no longer exists.
- `ao.getTraceSettings()` now returns a settings object with the `traceTaskId`
property instead of the `metadata` property.
- the `Span` class method `exitWithError()` is now `exitCheckingError()` to
better describe what it is doing.
- `ao.stringToMetadata()` => `ao.xtraceToEvent()`
- `Span.last` has been removed. Use `ao.lastSpan`.
- `Event.last` has been removed. Use `ao.lastEvent`.

## appoptics-apm migration guide v5 => v6

### Background

Prior to v6 `appoptics-apm` made the decision whether to sample or not in the `Event` constructor. `appoptics-apm` now makes the decision at the starting point of a trace, e.g., the `http` probe. This change simplifies the code but introduces breaking changes if you are using custom-instrumentation.

If you are using instrumentation out-of-the-box, i.e., you have not written any custom instrumentation, no changes are necessary to migrate to v6.

If you are using custom instrumentation read on!

### High-level API change

In both v5 and v6 the span argument to an instrumentation function could be a string or a function. In v6 the function signature has changed.

- in v5 the function received an argument of the previous span and returned a created span, e.g., `span = spanMaker(lastSpan)`
- in v6 the function receives no arguments and returns a plain object, `spanInfo` (see `spanInfo` in guides/api.md). `spanInfo` properties:
    - required - a string `name` property. This is what the span will be named.
    - optional - an object `kvpairs` property. This contains key-value pairs to attach to the span's entry envent.
    - optional - a function `finalize` property. This is called after creating the span. The newly created span is its argument. The primary use for this is internal.

In v5 the option `enabled` defaulted to `false`. In v6 it defaults to `true`.

These are the functions that require changes if they are being called with a span-builder function or the presumption that no options argument defaults `enabled` to `false`. No change is necessary if they are being called with a string span name or an options argument with `{enabled: true}`.

- `ao.instrument`
- `ao.instrumentHttp`
- `ao.startOrContinueTrace`

```
// v5 spanMaker, options are required because enabled defaults to false
function spanMaker (last) {
    return last.descend('awesome-span', {special: 'special-value'})
}
return ao.instrument(spanMaker, runner, {enabled: true}, cb)


// v6 - spanInfo, note that enabled defaults to true.
function spanInfo () {
    return {name: 'awesome-span', kvpairs: {special: 'special-value}}
}
return ao.instrument(spanInfo, runner, cb)

```

### Low-level API changes

There are numerous low-level API changes so if you're working at this lower level feel free to contact us as this is list only hits the most obvious.

- `ao.sample()` has been removed and `ao.getTraceSettings()` is now used to determine all trace settings.
- `Span` constructor signature has changed. v5: `new Span(name, parent, kvpairs)` v6: `new Span(name, settings, kvpairs)` where settings is the object returned by `getTraceSettings()`.
- the span factory, `Span.makeEntrySpan()` is used to create top-level, e.g., http, spans. This replaces directly calling the `Span` constructor with the right combination of arguments.
- `Event` constructor signature has changed. v5: `new Event(span, label, parent)` v6: `new Event(span, label, parent, edge)`. The added edge argument is the most obvious change, but parent must now be an instance of `addon.Event` or `addon.Metadata`. The event constructor uses this metadata to construct the event; it will no longer create random metadata on its own.
- `ao.sampleSource` has been removed. Use `settings.source` from `settings = getTraceSettings()`.
- `ao.sampleMode` has been removed. Use `ao.traceMode`.
- `traceMode`s `always` and `never` are deprecated. Use `enabled` and `disabled`.
    - removed sugar mode detectors `ao.always` and `ao.never`
- `ao.addon` - there are many breaking changes. If you are using an of these functions directly let us know and we'll work with you to update your code.
