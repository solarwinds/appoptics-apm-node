# Two minutes on how it works

`/lib/index.js` runs when the user's code requires `appoptics-apm`. It uses
`lib/get-unified-config.js` to determine the configuration and sets up the
agent. Eventually it reads the files in `lib/probes` and enables patching.

The patching mechanism works by intercepting `require(...)` calls. It is in
`lib/require-patch.js`.

Tests live in the `test` directory, with a `test/probes` sub-directory for tests
specific to a given instrumented module. The file in `test` follow a naming
scheme of `${name}.test.js` for files intended to be run by the test runner,
files with the normal scheme of `${name}.js` are just meant to be used by other files
in the test directory.


# Local Development

Development **must be done on Linux**.

To setup a development environment on a Mac use a Docker container (see below).

Mac should have:
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  * [Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools) (simply installed by terminal `git` command)
  * [SSH keys at github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Those are available in the Docker Dev Container.


## Project layout

* `lib/` contains the core modules that implement the agent.
* `lib/probes` contains code that patches auto-instrumented modules (a.k.a probes).
* `test/` contains the mocha based test suite.
* `test/probes/` contains tests for the auto-instrumented modules (a.k.a probes).
* `test/java-collector` contains a local collector usable for testing. `test/certs/` contains certificates for the collector.
* `.github` contains the files for github actions.
* `dev` directory contains anything related to dev environment


## Docker Dev Container

1. Start the Docker daemon (on a Mac that would be simplest using Docker desktop).
2. Create a `.env` file and set: 
- `APPOPTICS_SERVICE_KEY={any string that looks like a valid service key}`
- `SW_APM_TEST_COLLECTOR={a url of a collector}`
- `SW_APM_TEST_SERVICE_KEY={a valid service key for the collector above}`.

3. Run `npm run dev`. This will:
  - Create a docker container, set it up, and open a shell. Docker container will have all required build tools, nvm and multiple versions of node preinstalled, as well as nano installed, and access to GitHub SSH keys as configured. Repo code is **mounted** to the container.
  - Set up several "support containers" to be instrumented by tests (e.g. mongodb).

4. To open another shell in same container use: `docker exec -it dev-agent /bin/bash`

The setup script ensures a "clean" work place with each run by removing artifacts and installed modules on each exit.

## Instrumenting Using Local Code

The Agent dev environment mounts the code into `usr/src/work` and also mounts two siblings directories if they exist: `bindings` and `instrumented`.
The former should hold a clone of the bindings repo, the latter is for the `node-instrumented` repo clone. It is meant to act as a "playground" to build and instrument real node apps (e.g. an app that uses `express` as the web server and `morgan` for logging). This setup allows linking local versions of bindings and agent for end-to-end development.

### Linking to Bindings

1. Start the bindings dev environment: `npm run dev`.
2. Start the agent dev environment: `npm run dev`
3. Link the bindings: `npm link ../bindings --save`

Notes: 
- Order is important.
- Dev environments "clean up" when the container is stopped. They must be started in order for linking to work.
- In the bindings dev environment run `npm rebuild` when making c++ code changes.

### Linking to Instrumented App

1. Open a new shell to the dev environment

`docker exec -it -w /usr/src/instrumented dev-agent bash -c "unset APPOPTICS_REPORTER && unset APPOPTICS_COLLECTOR && bash"`

Note:
- dev environment uses UDP reporter and a local host collector. The new shell shall use the default (production) instead.

2. cd into the instrumented app directory (e.g `cd frameworks/fs`)
3. Remove previous installs `rm -rf node_modules` (if exists).
4. Reinstall dependencies `npm install`.
3. Link the agent: `npm link {../relative_path}` (e.g. `npm link ../../../work --save`)

Tip: if `npm link` output `Error: Argument #2: Expected array but got string` it is because the path is not pointing at a valid package. Try to add or remove dots...

## Testing

Test are run using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).

1. Run `npm test` to run the test suite. All tests, but one, run using a mock reporter that listens on UDP port 7832 (hard-coded in `test/helper.js`). The mock reporter intercepts UDP messages and checks them for correctness.

The `test` script in `package.json` runs `test.sh` which then manages how mocha runs each test file. To run individual tests use `npx mocha`. For example: `npx mocha test/probes/http.test.js` will run the `http` native module instrumentation tests.

## Docs

The repo includes API docs that are auto generated from code comments.
`npm run docs:api`.


## Dev Repo

The dev repo setup allows to run end-to-end npm release process in a development environment.
It also greatly simplifies creating and testing CI integrations such as GitHub Actions.

It contains:
  - dev repo: https://github.com/appoptics/appoptics-apm-node-dev (private, permissions via AppOptics Organization admin)

The dev repo was cloned from the main repo and setup with the appropriate secrets.

To set the main repo to work with the dev repo:

1. `git remote -v`
2. `git remote add dev git@github.com:appoptics/appoptics-apm-node-dev.git`
3. `npm run dev:repo:reset`

The script will:
  - Force push all branches and tags to dev repo.
  - Remove the local dev repo and clone a fresh one into a sibling directory. 
  - Modify package.json:
  ```
  "name": "appoptics-apm-node-dev",
  ```
  - Commit updated `package.json` to `master` all branches.

To start fresh on the dev repo run `npm run dev:repo:reset` again.

When running a Release process on the dev repo, the package will be published to https://www.npmjs.com/package/appoptics-apm-node-dev. It should be [unpublished](https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry) as soon as possible.
