# Development & Release with GitHub Actions 

> **tl;dr** Push to feature branch. Create Pull Request. Merge Pull Request. Push version tag to release.

## Overview

The package is dependent on the upstream package [solarwinds-apm-bindings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solarwinds-apm-bindings) which contains a binary node add-on. 

End users do not directly install the upstream package. Hence, any release of the upstream package requires a release of this package. Versions however do not have to be synced and tere can be multiple releases of this package with same dependency on upstream package.

The upstream package uses a similar [Development & Release process](https://github.com/solarwindscloud/solarwinds-bindings-node/tree/main/.github#development--release-with-github-actions).

## Usage

### Prep - Push Dockerfile

* Push to main is disabled by branch protection.
* Push to branch which changes any Dockerfile in the `.github/docker-node/` directory will trigger [docker-node.yml](./workflows/docker-node.yml).
* Workflow will:
  - Build all Dockerfile and create a [single package](https://github.com/solarwindscloud/solarwinds-apm-node/pkgs/container/solarwinds-apm-node%2Fnode-agent-runner) named `node-agent-runner` scoped to solarwindscloud/solarwinds-apm-node (the repo). The workflow is triggered by a push of a Dockerfile. Hence it has already ran successfully on commits in this Pull Request. Since this repo is public, the image is also public.
* Workflow creates (or recreates) image used in other workflows.
* Manual trigger supported.

```
push Dockerfile ─► ┌───────────────────┐ ─► ─► ─► ─► ─►
                   │Build Docker Images│ build & publish
manual ──────────► └───────────────────┘     
```

### Develop - Push

* Push to main is disabled by branch protection.
* Push to branch will trigger [push.yml](./workflows/push.yml). 
* Workflow will:
  - Run core tests on single node version set on the GitHub Actions runner. 
* Workflow confirms code is not "broken".
* Manual trigger supported. Enables to select node version to run on.
* Naming a branch with `-no-action` ending disables this workflow. Use for documentation branches edited via GitHub UI.
```
push to branch ──► ┌────────────────┐ 
                   │Single Core Test│ 
manual (image?) ─► └────────────────┘ 
```

### Review - Pull Request

* Creating a pull request will trigger [review.yml](./workflows/review.yml). 
* Workflow will:
  - Run full test suite on single node version inside a container linked to a network of service containers. 
* Workflow confirms code for probes work as expected.
* Manual trigger supported. Enables to select node version to run on.
```
pull request ────► ┌──────────────────────────┐
                   │Single Networked Full Test│
manual ──────────► └──────────────────────────┘
```
### Accept - Merge Pull Request 

* Merging a pull request will trigger [accept.yml](./workflows/accept.yml). 
* Workflow will:
  - Run full test suite on a matrix of node versions inside a container linked to a network of service containers. 
* Workflow confirms code for probes work as expected on all supported node versions.
* Manual trigger supported.
```

merge to main   ─► ┌──────────────────────────┐
                   │Matrix Networked Full Test│
manual ──────────► └──────────────────────────┘
```

### Release - Push Version Tag

* Release process is `npm` and `git` triggered.
* To Release:
  1. On branch run `npm version {major/minor/patch}`(e.g. `npm version patch`) then have the branch pass through the Push/Pull/Merge flow above. 
  2. When ready `git push` origin {tag name} (e.g. `git push origin v11.2.3`).
* Pushing a semantic versioning tag for a patch/minor/major versions (e.g. `v11.2.3`) or an alpha tagged pre-release (e.g. `v11.2.3-alpha.2`) will trigger [release.yml](./workflows/release.yml). Pushing other pre-release tags (e.g. `v11.2.3-7`) is ignored.
* Workflow will: 
  - Publish an NPM package. When version tag is `alpha`, package will be NPM tagged same. When it is a release version, package will be NPM tagged `latest`.
* Workflow publishes.

```
push semver tag ─► ┌───────────┐
push alpha tag     │NPM Publish│
                   └───────────┘
```


### Verify - after Release

* Runs after the Release workflow has completed.
* Workflow will:
  - Load the Target Group from the bindings repo and for each image in group:
  - Install Agent (either the released version or the one specified manually).
  - Check that installation of binary completed successfully (either from prebuilt tarball or from source).
  - Start an instrumented http server to confirm auto instrumentation against staging is working.
  - Run a simulation http client to generate data on staging backend.
  - Start an instrumented http server to confirm auto instrumentation against production is working.
* Workflow provides confidence that a released package can successfully install and auto instrument apps on a wide variety of node and operating system combinations.
* Manual trigger supported.


```
workflow_run    ─► ┌───────────┐
completed          │   Verify  │
                   └───────────┘
```

### Document - Manual

* Runs only manually 
* Workflow will:
  - Run a [`testeachversion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testeachversion) per package in a matrix.
  - Generate a summary file
  - Creates an automated commit into branch.
  - Opens a pull request. 
* Workflow results are in the `docs` directory:
  - `supported-components.human` file including a list of supported components per node version.
  - `supported-components-data` directory with summary and raw data for each package.

* Notes: 
- The workflow is WIP.
- `testeachversion` is used as-is. Since it was not built for parallel run on @github @actions, some “rough patching” is required.
- It uses `continue-on-error: true` so that if a set of tests fails for a specific version of a package, the whole workflow will still complete. Thus in the run results the jobs are all ✅ while there is annotations below suggesting failures ❌. 

## Maintenance

> **tl;dr** There is no need to modify workflows. All data used is externalized.

### Definitions
* Local image is defined in [docker-node](./docker-node).
* [Target Group](./config/target-group.json) images include a wide variety of OS and Node version combinations. Group includes both images that can build from code as well as those which can not.

### Adding a Node Version

1. Modify the Accept workflow.
2. Modify the Document workflow.

### Remove a node version

1. Remove version images from appropriate group json file in `config`.
2. Leave `docker-node` Dockerfiles for future reference.

## Implementation

> **tl;dr** No Actions used. Matrix and Container directive used throughout.

### Workflows

1. All workflows `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`.
2. For maintainability and security custom actions are avoided.
3. Since the scripts used are not a "formal" actions they are placed in a `script` directory.
4. The client/server duo used is not packaged as a "formal" action it and is thus placed in a `utils` directory.
5. All job steps are named.
6. Jobs are linked using `needs:`.

### Secrets

Repo is defined with the following secrets:
```
SW_APM_SERVICE_KEY
SW_TEST_SERVICE_KEY
SW_TEST_COLLECTOR
SW_APM_TEST_PROD_SERVICE_KEY
SW_APM_TEST_PROD_COLLECTOR
NPM_AUTH_TOKEN
```
